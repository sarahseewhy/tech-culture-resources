# Tech-Culture Resources

The following is a work-in-progress list of resources for learning more about the intersection of technology and cultural studies.

I encourage folks to propose additions because this isn't a complete list. Ideally it'll be continually improving and expanding.

The goal of this project is to provide a starting off point for further research and contribute to informed discussions about the intersection of technology and culture.
